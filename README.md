# rdumtool - RDTech UM24C/UM25C/UM34C Bluetooth interface tool

*This script is currently in an early stage and could change significantly.*

The RDTech [UM24C](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/RD-UM24-UM24C-for-APP-USB-2-0-LCD-Display-Voltmeter-ammeter-battery-charge-voltage-current/32845522857.html), [UM25C](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/RD-UM25-UM25C-for-APP-USB-2-0-Type-C-LCD-Voltmeter-ammeter-voltage-current-meter/923042_32855845265.html) and [UM34C](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/RD-UM34-UM34C-for-APP-USB-3-0-Type-C-DC-Voltmeter-ammeter-voltage-current-meter/923042_32880908871.html) are low-cost USB pass-through power measurement devices, and support a decent number of collection features, as well as full control via Bluetooth.  (The non-C versions of these devices support the same features as the C versions, but without Bluetooth control.)  This program implements all exposed commands and data collection available by the device's Bluetooth interface.

## Setup

```
$ bluetoothctl

[bluetooth]# scan on
Discovery started
[bluetooth]# list
00:90:72:56:98:D7 UM24C
# MAC will vary by device
[bluetooth]# pair 00:90:72:56:98:D7
Attempting to pair with 00:90:72:56:98:D7
[CHG] Device 00:90:72:56:98:D7 Connected: yes
Request PIN code
[UM24C[agent] Enter PIN code: 1234
# Enter literal "1234" here
[bluetooth]# trust 00:90:72:56:98:D7
[CHG] Device 00:90:72:56:98:D7 Trusted: yes
Changing 00:90:72:56:98:D7 trust succeeded
```

## Usage

At this point, to use the Bluetooth device directly, you will need [PyBluez](https://pypi.org/project/PyBluez/).  Debian and Ubuntu only added Python 3 versions (python3-bluez) recently (as of early 2019), so if not available via apt, you will need to install it via pip.  With PyBluez available, you can run:

```
$ rdumtool --device-type=UM24C --bluetooth-device=00:90:72:56:98:D7
```

Alternatively, with [pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/) required, you can bind it to a serial device:

```
$ sudo rfcomm bind 0 00:90:72:56:98:D7
$ rdumtool --device-type=UM24C --serial-device=/dev/rfcomm0
```

Without any additional arguments, rdumtool will display all information available from the UM24C/UM25C.  There are various additional flags to set parameters in the UM24C/UM25C such as threshold logging; see ```rdumtool --help``` for details.

## Example

```
$ rdumtool --device-type=UM24C --bluetooth-device=00:90:72:56:98:D7 --rotate-screen --set-record-threshold=0.20

$ rdumtool --device-type=UM24C --bluetooth-device=00:90:72:56:98:D7

## Miscellaneous

Thanks to [the sigrok wiki](https://sigrok.org/wiki/RDTech_UM24C) for a reverse engineering of the UM24C's communication protocol, which was referenced to produce this tool.

I currently have a UM25C and a UM34C on order.  As of this writing, this program's UM25C/UM34C support is guessed from various (incomplete) information online.  Once I have hardware in hand, I will verify compatibility and update if necessary.
